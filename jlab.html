<h1>Junior Laboratory</h1>
<h2>Feb 2017 - May 2017</h2>

<p class='para'>Junior Laboratory (8.13) is an experimental physics class offered to upperclassmen in the MIT Physics Department. During the class, students collect data, give oral presentations, and write techincal manuscripts for four famous or fundamental experiments. I took this class as a Junior in Spring 2017, and I am a Teaching Assistant for the course this fall.</p>

<p class='para'>Below is a list of the experiments I did with my lab partner, Carissa Skye, along with a link to the techincal manuscripts I wrote.</p>
	<ul class='para'>
	<li><b><a target='_blank' href='jlab/photoelectric.pdf'>Photoelectric Effect</a>: </b>This famous experiment demonstrates the quantization of light into photons and allows us to determine a value for Planck's constant. The manuscript can be found <u><a target='_blank' href='jlab/photoelectric.pdf'>here</a></u>.</li>

	<li><b><a target='_blank' href='jlab/opticaltrap.pdf'>Optical Trapping</a>: </b>When a laser is focused down to a small radius, micron-sized objects can become trapped in the laser due to the force exerted by photons refracting through the object. Such a set up is referred to as "optical tweezers" or an "optical trap". Optical traps are often used in biophysics to measure the forces of small molecules. With the Junior Lab optical trap, we were able to measure the force exerted by myosin proteins on vesicles in onion cells. The manuscript can be found <u><a target='_blank' href='jlab/opticaltrap.pdf'>here</a></u>.</li>

	<li><b><a target='_blank' href='jlab/spectroscopy.pdf'>Atomic Spectroscopy of Hydrogenic Atoms</a>: </b>The Balmer series contains energy level transitions in the hydrogen atom that fall in the visible spectrum of light. We used a monochrometer to measure those transition wavelengths in hydrogen and dueterium, allowing us to find the ratio of the two atom's nuclear masses. In addition to this, we measured the energy level transitions of Sodium and found its fine-structure splitting. The manuscript can be found <u><a target='_blank' href='jlab/spectroscopy.pdf'>here</a></u>.</li>

	<li><b><a target='_blank' href='jlab/muons.pdf'>Cosmic Ray Muons</a>: </b>Cosmic ray muons, unstable particles that decay into electrons, are formed high in the Earth's atmosphere and travel towards the ground at velocities near the speed of light. By measuring the speed and lifetime of muons detected in the lab, we could show that special relativity is necessary for understanding how they can reach sea level before decaying. The manuscript can be found <u><a target='_blank' href='jlab/muons.pdf'>here</a></u>.</li>
	</ul>

<p class='para'>At the end of the semester, I gave a public oral presentation on the Optical Trapping experiment to the class and teaching staff. My slides can be viewed <u><a target='_blank' href='jlab/opticaltrap_slides.pdf'>here</a></u>.</p>
